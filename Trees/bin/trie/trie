what is a trie? why we need trie?
A Trie is a tree-based data structure that organizes information in a hierarchy

properties:
1. It is typically used to store or search strings in a space and time efficient way.
2. Any node in trie can store non repetitive multiple characters
3. Every node stores link of the next character of the string
4. Every node keeps track of 'end of string'

why we need trie:
To solve many standard problem in efficient way
1. spelling checker
2. Auto Completion (e.g:- google search - if we search "algorithm" the next characters will be suggested in google)

common Operations on Tire:
1. Creation of Tire
2. Insertion in Tire
3. Search for a string in tire
4. Deletion from Tire
