Sorting:
Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format either ascending or descending

Types Of Sorting:
--> Based on space used:
	1. In place Sorting: Sorting algorithms which does not require any extra space for sorting (e.g:- Bubble sort)
	2. Out place Sorting: Sorting algorithms which requires an extra space for sorting
--> Based on Stability:
	1. Stable sorting: If a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents does not change the sequence of similar content in which they appear, then this sorting is called stable sorting. (e.g:- Insertion sort)
	2. Unstable sorting: If a sorting algorithm after sorting the content changes the sequence of similar content in which they appear, then this sorting is called unstable sorting. (e.g:- Quick sort)

Sorting Terminology:
1. Increasing order: If successive element is greater than the previous one (e.g:- 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)
2. Decreasing Order: If successive element is less than the previous one (e.g:- 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1)
3. Non Increasing order: If successive element is less than or equal to its previous element in the sequence. (e.g:- 11, 9, 7, 5, 5, 3, 1)
4. Non Decreasing order: If successive element is greater than or equal to its [previous element in the sequence. (e.g:- 1, 3, 5, 7, 7, 9, 11)

Sorting Algorithms:
1. BubbleSort or SinkingSort
2. SelectionSort
3. InsertionSort
4. BucketSort
5. MergeSort
6. QuickSort
7. HeapSort
