Divide and Conquer Algorithm:
Divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm which works by recursively breaking down a problem into subproblems of similar type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
The solutions of the subproblems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

property of divide and conquer Algorithm:
Optimal Substructure: If any problem's overall optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblem then this problem has optimal substructure
eg:- Fib(n) = fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
