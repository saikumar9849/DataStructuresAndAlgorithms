what is Hashing? why we need it?
Hashing is a method of sorting and indexing data. the idea behind hashing is to allow large amounts of data. The idea behind hashing is to allow large amounts of data to be indexed using keys commonly created by formulas.
It is time efficient in case of search operations (O(1)/O(n))

Hashing Terminology:
Hash function: It is a function that can be used to map of arbitrary size of data of fixed size.
Key: Input data by a user
Hash value: A value that is returned by Hash function
Hash table: It is a data structure which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values
Collision: A collision occurs when two different keys to a hash function produce the same output.

Hash functions (e.g's):
1. mod function: int mod(int number, int size) { return number%size; }
2. ASCII function:
int modASCII(String word, int cellNumber) {
	int total = 0;
	for(int i=0;i<word.length();i++){
		total+=word.charAt(i);
	}
	return total%cellNumber;
}

properties of good Hash function:
1. It distributes hash values uniformly across hash tables
2. It has to use all the input data.

Types of collision Resolution techniques.
1. Direct chaining
2. Open Addressing: Colliding elements are stored in other vacant buckets. During storage and lookup these are found through so called probing.
	-Linear probing
	-Quadratic probing
	-Double Hashing
